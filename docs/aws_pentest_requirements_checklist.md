- [ ] A role should be created for the security auditor that provides them with read-only access to all the resources in the AWS Account. 
AWS has simplified this by providing a built in security audit policy with ARN `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit` that can be 
attached to a role which can then be assumed by the testers. If there are multiple accounts then this role should be provisioned to 
allow it to assume other roles in the other accounts for testing.
- [ ] The above role should grant both CLI and Console access. CLI access will ensure that testers can run automated tools like `AWS Scout` and the console provides a user-friendly interface which can also be used to take screenshots as evidence
- [ ] For internal testing, an AWS EC2 instance or on-premises device that can access all the subnets in the AWS Account should be provisioned with local administrator access. Ideally this machine should also be able to access the internet so that testers can easily access tools they may need if the need arises during testing. If internet access is restricted, the testers should make a list of tools that they require so that it can be provisioned prior to testing. See [here](https://github.com/berylliumsec/_petusawo_/blob/main/docs/aws_playbook.md) for a list of tools to consider besides standard testing tools. It should be noted that AWS CLI commands can be ran from anywhere that has internet access.
- [ ] A list of all AWS resources. A report can be generated using AWS config and handed over to the penetration testers or assessors. This repository also contains a python script that generates a list of all AWS services in use, as long as the required AWS ENV. See the main readme section for more information.
