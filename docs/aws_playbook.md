# AWS Audit and Hacking Playbook

## Auditing Tools

### Cloudformation Script / Dockerfile/ Docker Image / Git Repository Analysis

Analyzing docker images for vulnerabilities is important to determine if there are dependencies in the base or layered docker images that contain
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

Analyzing Cloud formation scripts is important to ensure practices are being followed and that IaC is deployed in a secure manner.

Git repositories that contain cloud resource configurations should also be analyzed to ensure that secrets are not being stored therein. 

[Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure as code (IaC) and also a software composition
analysis (SCA) tool for images and open source packages. It can be used to analyze cloudformation scripts for best practices, secrets etc

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a security tool that can be used to analyze docker images for vulnerabilities. 

[Git secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) can be used to analyze git repositories to ensure that they are not storing any secrets

### OSINT:

Open source intelligence can be a valuable when analyzing the attack surface area of a cloud environment. You can often find S3 buckets with public objects,

EC2 instances that can be accessed directly from the internet, misconfigured cloudfront, leaked secrets etc.

- If the AWS environment is hosting a domain, you can start by searching for the domain in the [Have I Been Pawned Website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/DomainSearch)

- Using [shodan](https://www.shodan.io), ensure that the AWS environment is not exposing any IoT device endpoints, you can make this easy by searching for the entire IP address range for the cloud account that is being audited.

### AWS Configuration Analysis

[Scout Suite](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) is an open source multi-cloud security-auditing tool, which enables security posture assessment of cloud environments. 
You can catch the majority of misconfigurations using scout suite.


## Manual Checks

- **Instance Metadata**

Instance metadata is a source of information about your running instances, consisting of categories such as host name, events, and security groups. You can also use this data to access user data that you provided when launching the instance. 

The instance metadata should be turned off if it is not being used, and if it is being used, ensure that it is IMDSv2 not IMDSv1. This is because it can be compromised
through a myriad of techniques, some of which are Server-Side Request Forgery, Proxies, DNS Rebinding etc

The rationale behind this is that if you have access to an instance the data stored within the instance is not safeguarded with authentication or encryption. In addition, if an application running on the instance is compromised, the metadata can easily be accessed. Therefore, it is not a secure place to store sensitive information such as 
passwords or long-term encryption keys.

Exploit Techniques:

To check if an instance is running IMDSv1, simply run the following command from within the instance:

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
```

If you received the error code `401` then it must be running IMDSv2 otherwise it us running IMDSv1.

Let's take the case of an EC2 instance who's administrator's password was set using userdata.An attacker who has gained access to the instance or compromised an application or service running on the instance can easily retrieve the administrator's password by running the following command:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600") \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

The results will look like:

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-xx-xx-xx ~]$ TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600") \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

```

You can do a complete enumeration using the following command:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/RESULTS berryliumsec/petusawo:latest enumerate_aws_meta_data
```

The result will be written to a file named `aws_metadata.log` in the directory where you ran the above command.



Mitigation

You can turn off access to your instance metadata by disabling the HTTP endpoint of the instance metadata service. If you do not specify a value, the default is to enable the HTTP endpoint.


Configure EC2 Instances to use IMDSv2:

Amazon Linux is configured by default to use IMDSv2 but other operating systems, so they will need to be manually configured. You can find more information in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html)


 
- **Cognito Pools**: Ensure that AWS cognito pools do not support unauthenticated identities. You can find more information about how to activate or deactivate guest access on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html) in
the `Activate or deactivate guest access` section
